# SQL-Dictionary-Project

As I was browsing the web, looking for ideas on how to improve my SQL skills by *doing* rather than by reading. While reading is extremely valuable, especially at the early stages of picking up a new skill, I have always seen the bulk of my growth come from using what I have learned in a project. 

...

I fixed errors in Excel by highlighting the "words" column and using the "Go To Special..." function and used "Find & Select" to get rid of entries that included spaces.

Using the LEN function, I was able to determine that the longest entry was 21 characters long which served useful when creating the table using SQL. I saved the list as a separate CSV to later import into PostgreSQL.
